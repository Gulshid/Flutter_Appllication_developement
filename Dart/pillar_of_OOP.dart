            (Inheritence)(Encapsulation)(Abstraction)(Polymorphism)   


            1.Inheritence:-In class we use inheritence,Inheritence the base(parent) 
              class we inherit in our  derived(child) class. The  parent base class 
              properties can be Access or showing in derived(child )class.
            
            2.Encapsulation:-In Enccapsulation in class we can hide or unhide some
              properties of class such as Public or private used we call it Access specifiers.

            3.Abstraction:-the Abstraction special type of class function which we can inherit 
                in derived class but must we have to assign some functionalities in this Abstract class function.
            
            4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism ,poly means "many" and morphism means 
                "shape" . The polymorphism means the object which have many shape
